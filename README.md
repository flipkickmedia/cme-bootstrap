## Welcome to the flipkick CME-bootstrap

This isn't bootstrap for building web pages, it's a method of installing a cluster on your existing hardware and scaling into the cloud, safely, securely and more importantly, cost effectively. It also provides a nice way of developing true µMicroservices, so  you can build app code like kids build lego and write code with your head focussed on the problem not on the 95% of crap developers are meant to do these days!

### Github Note

This is a mirror of the repository provided at [this repository](https://git.flipkick.media:cme/git-bootstrap.git)

We cant use github for µServices as we are unable to create domains and organisations and this sorta makes organising true µServices impossible. Get your own git repository and use [Gitea](https://gitea.io)

The CME is designed to enable anyone to run a cluster and only use cloud services when they need to scale. Your on premis hardware, laptops and old hardware will probably be enough to power your entire business. Why pay for it when you already have it?

### Getting Started

If you have a Windows 10 machine, a linux server, raspberry pi or pretty much any device which can run linux you can get started.

### Windows 10

Currently we only support WSL2, and this is only available using a windows insider build but mainstream support is shortly on it's way.

To install the WSL2 Instance you first need to get the [cme-bootstrap-win repository](http://git.flipkick.media:cme/cme-bootstrap-win.git)

Once you have this, launch the WSL2 shell and run the install.sh script.

### Linux 

We prefer Ubuntu or Alpine as these are the most popular, best supported systems available. Other linux distributions may work if they use a Debian (APT) or Redhat (YUM) based installers for their packages.

To install the Linux CME you will need to simply clone the cme-boostrap.git repository and run the install.sh script. This will install the source code.
